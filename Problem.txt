Problem Statement: C4PC1.2 – Online Computer Quiz 
 
An online, interschool computer quiz was organized by a community school.10 different schools 
participated in the quiz. The quiz scores of all the schools are available. Perform the following 
activities on the scores: 
 
1. Find the school that has scored the highest. 
2. Find the average score among the 10 schools. 
 
Note:

and have to be stored in a string array. 
• Later while finding the highest score, the quiz score needs to be converted into an integer. 
• Use exception handling wherever required. 
Hint: Handle InputMismatchException, NumberFormatException and 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException.
